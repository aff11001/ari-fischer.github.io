<p><img src="/_assets/profile_photo.jpg" alt="headshot" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>I earned my PhD in Chemical Engineering at the University of California (2021). My doctoral studies focused on the fundamental mechanisms behind metal-catalyzed hydrogenation reactions and the synergies between metals and proximate metal oxides with exposed Lewis centers, historically referred to as “hydrogen spillover.”</p>

<p>I am currently a research fellow at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. I apply multiscale modelling, computational chemistry tools, and mechanistic inquiry to explore the nature of oxidation reactions driven by ultrasound.</p>

<p>My research interests lie at the nexus of heterogeneous catalysis and sustainability.</p>

<p>My scientific interests lie in reaction kinetics, multi-scale modeling, and statistical mechanics.</p>
