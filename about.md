# About me

![headshot](/_assets/profile_photo.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

I earned my PhD in Chemical Engineering at the University of California (2021). My doctoral studies focused on the fundamental mechanisms behind metal-catalyzed hydrogenation reactions and the synergies between metals and proximate metal oxides with exposed Lewis centers, historically referred to as "hydrogen spillover." 

I am currently a research fellow at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. I apply multiscale modelling, computational chemistry tools, and mechanistic inquiry to explore the nature of oxidation reactions driven by ultrasound. 

My research interests lie at the nexus of heterogeneous catalysis and sustainability.

My scientific interests lie in reaction kinetics, multi-scale modeling, and statistical mechanics.
